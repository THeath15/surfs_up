# **Overview :Surfs_up**

While on vacation in Hawaii last year, I discovered a a passion in surfing and came up with an idea investing on a wave and ice cream business to tourist , with enough savings I get interested in investing but need some investor backing and  reached to an investor .W. Avy  who invested on same business before and he asked for some data weather analytics on the location I plan to put up the business.

W.Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


# **Results:** 
To anaylyze the weather data trends, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database. 
1. The statistical information gathered from the dbase query  shows an average temp of 75°F for June which is higher than the mean for December at 71° and are quite close and indicates nominal result.

2. December indicatees a  precipitation of .22 inches while June had .14 inches.

3. The min temp shows 64°F for June and 56°F, and max temperatures shows 85°F and is quite close to 83F for December.


The mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December. However, the opposite is true for precipitation. December had the higher precipitation of .22 inches while June had .14 inches.
