# **Overview :Surfs_up**

While on vacation in Hawaii last year, I discovered a a passion in surfing and came up with an idea investing on a wave and ice cream business to tourist ,with enough savings I get interested in investing but need some investor backing and   reached to an investor .W. Avy  who invested on same business before.and he asked for some data weather analytics on the locatio I plan to put up the business.

W.Avy ants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
